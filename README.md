2) METUSAT (A Satellite From Middle East Technical University) participating in the 2015
International CANSAT (can satellite) competition organized by AAS: 

Brief Steps of the Mission:
METUSAT secured in a container will be sent ~1 km high with a rocket.
METUSAT and the container will be released at that altitude from the rocket.
Once stabilized, METUSAT will separate from the container.
METUSAT will descend in a stable way at a constant velocity.
This will be ensured by a 2-layer auto-gyro system and a reaction wheel.
During descent, METUSAT will record the temperature, pressure, its acceleration, speed and position, its
software status and send it constantly to a ground control station.
To prove stability, a video of the descent (showing the ground closing up) will be shot and
analyzed after the landing.
Furthermore, to prove its abilities as a secure payload transporter, it will carry an egg which
should be collected intact after the landing.

METUSAT received 4th place position in this competition, despite managing to land in the 
only pond inthe competition area in Abilene, Texas. The water corrupted the SD card where
the video of the descent was stored. It has successfully completed every other task except the
recovery of the video. Even without the stability of descent, the stability could be verified
from the accelerometer data.

3) UniverseMaker:  A game in projessing.js where the player tries to make the universe by
controlling the fundamental forces after the Big Bang. 

Won the Most Educational Project Award in 2015 CERN Webfest

Members: Baran Bodur, Doga Veske, Armagan Dascurcu
